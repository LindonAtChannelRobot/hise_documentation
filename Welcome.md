## Introduction

**HISE** is a complete IDE for making virtual instruments. It tries to close a gap in todays virtual instrument market, where there is almost no open source software that allows you to design your own plugins.

You can create patches, design a custom interface, load them as plugin, or even extend the core engine with new DSP modules.

**Core Features:**

- versatile modulator system that allows dynamic modulation of different parameters and the usual suspects (envelopes, LFOs...)
- basic waveform generators for synthesing sounds
- Sampler engine with disk streaming, round robin, looping, sample start modulation
- .SFZ import
- Audio effects (delay, polyphonic filters, reverb, convolution, stereo fx)
- Macro control system that can be connected to any parameter / modulator.
- Scripting engine for customizable instrument behaviour.
- WYSIWYG editor for designing script interfaces
- Debugging tools like on screen console and data plotter for modulators.
- Sample editing interface with focus on workflow.
- Storable "View Configurations" to allow customizable workflow for bigger patches
