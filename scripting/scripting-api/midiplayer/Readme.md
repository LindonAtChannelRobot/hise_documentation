A `MidiPlayer` reference can be used to control the playback of a MIDI Player module 
as well as processing the currently loaded MIDI sequency. It also acts as event controller 
for building customised UI elements to display MIDI content.

 ```javascript
 const var MIDIPlayer1 = Synth.getMidiPlayer("MIDI Player1");
 ```
