Depending on your project architecture, it might make sense to limit the maximum buffer size that will be processed by your DSP module tree.

This will not guarantee that the buffer size is always the same, but rather split up the incoming buffer into chunks of this size. So if you have a 512 audio buffer and call `Engine.setMaximumBlockSize(300)`, then you will process alternating audio buffers of 300 and 212 samples.

> This is the "global" variant of the [container.fix_block](/scriptnode/list/container/fix8_block) nodes that perform this operation locally within a DSP network.

Obviously this will come with a slightly higher CPU load, but the benefits of having a defined upper limit for the buffer allows you to implement a few cross-module modulation concepts that would not be possible otherwise (as the cross-module communication usually happens once per buffer size, an update rate of 11ms eg. might not be good enough for envelope modulation signals etc).

Usually you're best bet is to not use this function until you really need it for your project to work.
