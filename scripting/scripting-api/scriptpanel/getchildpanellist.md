This creates an array with references to all panels that have been created using `addChildPanel()`. Be aware that this only takes one level of hierarchy into account, so if you have nested child panels, the list will only contain the top level panels.

See [`addChildPanel()`](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptpanel#addchildpanel), [`getParentPanel()`](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptpanel#getparentpanel) and [`removeFromParent()`](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptpanel#removefromparent)
