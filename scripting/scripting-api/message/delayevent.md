Be aware that if you call this method with a note on message, it will not delay the note-off message automatically too. You either have to ensure that your script performs this task in the respective note-off too or use the new API call [`Synth.setFixNoteOnAfterNoteOff()`](/scripting/scripting-api/synth#setfixnoteonafternoteoff) which performs a few safe checks to prevent stuck notes in this scenario.
