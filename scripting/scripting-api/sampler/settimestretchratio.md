This will change the time ratio of the sampler playback when timestretching is enabled.

Depending on the timestretch mode, this value will be applied to new voices or all currently active voices. For an explanation of the different modes, take a look at the [Sampler Module Documentation](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler#timestretching)

> Currently the time ratio is limited to 50% - 200% of the original time, but that limitation might be lifted at some point.
