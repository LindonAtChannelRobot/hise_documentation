This function expects either a String with a full path to the SFZ file or a [File](/scripting/scripting-api/file) object and will try to parse it and load the multisample set into the Sampler. This finally enables you to offer multisample import on your compiled plugin! 
Be aware that if you load a SFZ file, the sampler will not store this information automatically, so you need to add a UI component that stores that information and calls this function in its control callback. A suitable candidate for this would be a ScriptPanel with file-drop support using [this API function](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptpanel#setfiledropcallback)

> The SFZ importer is not fully standard compliant (at this point it's just the old HISE SFZ import that has been cleaned up a little bit). However the goal is to offer enough standard compliance so that all mapping information of a SFZ is being imported correctly and without crashing the plugin (obviously stuff like the envelope attack time will never be parsed). If you encounter an issue with a SFZ file, please post it in the forum, then I'll take a look.
