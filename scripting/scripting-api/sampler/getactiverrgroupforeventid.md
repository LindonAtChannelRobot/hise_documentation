This returns the group index for the given event ID. Be aware that the lifetime of this information is very short (only between calling the function `setActiveGroupForEventId()` and the next audio render callback). If you call this function with a "dangling" event ID (an event ID that was already processed or discarded after the audio render callback), it will simply return the active RR group (so basically the same as `getActiveRRGroup()`).
