This will set the [timestretching](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler#timestretching) options for the sampler using a JSON object. Usually you would get that object with [`Sampler.getTimestretchOptions()`](/scripting/scripting-api/sampler#gettimestretchoptions), apply your changes and then call this function with the modified object.
