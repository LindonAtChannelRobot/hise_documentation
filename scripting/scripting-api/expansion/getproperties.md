This returns a JSON object with the properties of the Expansion pack. Be aware that this might be subject to change, but the current properties are:

- `Name`: the name of the expansion pack
- `Version`: the version number of the expansion pack
- `Blowfish-Key`: the key that is used to encode the expansion pack data.

Protip: You might not want to display the blowfish key somewhere on your interface...
