If the expansion contains **User Presets**, they will be extracted automatically when you install the expansion the first time.  
However if you update an existing expansion, the installation procedure will not override the user presets by default. If you want to ship new / modified user presets with your expansion update, you will need to call this manually after the installation of the expansion is finished.  

The most convenient place for calling this method is the install callback that can be defined with [`Expansionhandler.setInstallCallback()`](/scripting/scripting-api/expansionhandler#setinstallcallback)
