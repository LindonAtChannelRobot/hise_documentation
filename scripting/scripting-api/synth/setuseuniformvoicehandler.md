This is a new feature introduced with HISE 3.5.0 and ensures that all sound generators will use the same voice index whenever a new voice is started. Synchronizing the voice indexes comes with a slight overhead (so it's disabled by default), but it allows you to use envelope modulators as global modulation source because now it can properly fetch the required modulation values because it's guaranteed that the voice indexes will match.

In order to use this function, call it with a container ID that you want to be used as root for the voice unification. This is not required to be the master container, so you can still perform additional MIDI processing (arpeggiators, glide scripts etc). However you need to ensure that beyond that point every sound generator will start not more than one voice for each incoming MIDI event.
