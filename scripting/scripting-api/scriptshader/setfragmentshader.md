Normally you don't need to use this method because the shader input will be defined when you create this object, but you can opt to use the same shader object but with a different input file if that suits your workflow.

The input parameter is the shader file name (without the `.glsl` extension and the file must be inside the Scripts folder of your project (it will be embedded like any other script file when you export the project).

As soon as you added a shader, you can select the file in the drop down menu to get the code editor that you can use to modify the shader.
