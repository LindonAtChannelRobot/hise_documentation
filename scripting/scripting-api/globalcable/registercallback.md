This function will register a callable object (either a inline function, a function or a broadcaster) to the cable. It expects a single argument that will contain the value of the cable. You can either register it as synchronous callback or as asynchronous callback. The latter will filter out repetitions and will be called on the UI thread.

Be aware that if you've set a range then the value that will be passed into the callback will be converted from the normalised 0...1 range to whatever range you need.
