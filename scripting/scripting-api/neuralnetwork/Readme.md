You can create a `NeuralNetwork` object with [Engine.createNeuralNetwork("String id")](/scripting/scripting-api/engine#createneuralnetwork). Please take a look at the [NeuralNetwork Sine Generator Snippet](/tutorials/scriptnode#neural-network-sine-generator) to take a look at a working example.


```javascript
const var nn = Engine.createNeuralNetwork("NeuralNetwork");

```
