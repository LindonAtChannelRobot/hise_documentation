The `Math` class is a collection of math functions that can be used in the scripting engine. It is a feature-complete clone of the "official" [Javascript Math object](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_math.asp).

Unless specified otherwise, the value type of the function is `double`.

## Playground

Try out the Math functions in this interactive code editor:

```!javascript
var input = 1.0;
var result = Math.sin(input);
Console.print(result);
```
