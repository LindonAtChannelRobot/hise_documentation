The `Math` class is a collection of math functions that can be used in the scripting engine. It is a feature-complete clone of the "official" [Javascript Math object](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_math.asp).

Unless specified otherwise, the value type of the function is `double`. Most of the functions are pretty self-explanatory if you managed to get through high school, but there are a few special function that deserve a more detailed explanation.

> If you're going to start out with SNEX or use the expression nodes in scriptnode, you might be happy to know that this class is also available there.

In the editor the `Math` keyword will also give you access to a few Math constants (PI, E).
