> `Math.smoothstep(x,0,2);`

This function is very popular in graphics programming because it allows a seemless transition between two values, but there are certainly a few interesting use cases for DSP scripting / MIDI processing too. A good explanation of this function can be found [here](https://thebookofshaders.com/glossary/?search=smoothstep).
