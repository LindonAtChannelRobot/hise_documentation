If you have included the .hxi as metadata during the [Sample export](/working-with-hise/menu-reference/export#export-samples-for-installer), you can use this function to automatically extract the samples, copy the expansion file (and encrypt it if you have user credentials available) and refresh the list.

This operation will be asynchronously executed on the sample loading thread, which means you can use the [`ScriptPanel.setLoadingCallback`](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptpanel#setloadingcallback) function which will notify the user about the progress (extracting large sample sets might take a while so you most likely want some indication about the process).
