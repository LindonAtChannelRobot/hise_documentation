# Video Tutorials

David Healey from [Xtant Audio](http://xtant-audio.com) started a very extensive series of video tutorials which may help you getting started with HISE.

The discussion about the tutorials can be found [here](http://forum.hise.audio/topic/207/video-tutorials).

## Tutorial 1: Building HISE from source

The tutorial goes through the process of building HISE from the source code that can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/christophhart/HISE).  
This is for Windows users only, but OSX chaps may adapt this pretty easily.

Building HISE from the source code yields two advantages:

1. You always have the latest and greatest code.
2. If you want to export instruments with HISE, you'll need the same tools so this might be a good preparation excercise.

## Tutorial 2: Project Management

It covers the project management system of HISE. Basically you put everything into one folder and HISE uses subfolders for each file type.
David does a great job explaining all those subfolders and file types.
