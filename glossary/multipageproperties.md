summary:  A list of all available elements & properties in the multipage dialog system

The [Multipage Dialog](/ui-components/plugin-components/multipagedialog) component provides a comprehensive set of tools to develop complex dialogs. The available elements are divided into three primary categories: UI Elements, Actions, and Layout.

You can use them either in the multipagecreator app in a graphical editor, or build them up [programmatically](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptmultipagedialog#add) using the Scripting API to the [ScriptMultipageDialog](/scripting/scripting-api/scriptmultipagedialog).

This document contains a autogenerated list of all available elements and properties. 

> Note for using it through the scripting API: If the property supplies any **Options**, the value must be one of the listed strings, otherwise it will require either a bool value or a string.

## Layout

These elements are used to arrange the UI elements (and actions) on the dialog and supply generic elements like spacers & text paragraphs. The multipage dialog uses a row / column system that you can use to create almost any 2D arrangement of layouts:

```
--------List--------
--------List--------
--------List--------
Column|Column|-List-
------|------|-List-
