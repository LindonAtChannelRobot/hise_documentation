You can create "factory presets" simply by adding User presets to your project. They will be embedded into the plugin and automatically extracted the first time the user launches your plugin.

Create your presets using the default HISE preset browser, they will automatically be saved in the UserPresets folder.

If there is already a user preset directory existing, it won't do anything. Try deleting (or renaming) your %APPDATA% user preset directory and reload the plugin.
