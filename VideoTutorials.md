These tutorial goes through the process of building HISE on GNU/Linux, Windows, and OSX using the source code that can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/christophhart/HISE).

Building HISE from the source code yields two advantages:

1. You always have the latest and greatest code.
2. If you want to export instruments with HISE, you'll need the same tools so this might be a good preparation excercise.
