A **HISE Module** is a basic Audio-DSP building block of HISE. You can stitch them together to create your instrument/plugin.  


- [Sound Generators](/hise-modules/sound-generators) 

- [Midi Processors](/hise-modules/midi-processors) 

- [Modulators](/hise-modules/modulators)

- [Effects](/hise-modules/effects) 

Every Module has a topbar with at least four controls:  
**Fold/Collapse > Processor ID > Bypass Button > and an X to delete it.** 

![transposer topbar](images/custom/transposer-topbar.png)

A **right click** on the topbar opens a dialog in which you can copy&paste the Module or create [script references](/scripting/scripting-in-hise#module-references) to it, if you want to access the modules parameters with scripting.
