This module is useful if you don't need the power and efficiency of buffered disk streaming and just want to play a single audio file - or let the end user load custom audio files into your plugin.

It can be connected to a [Audio Waveform](/ui-components/plugin-components/audio-waveform) on your UI - in this case the file that is loaded will also be stored in the user preset.
