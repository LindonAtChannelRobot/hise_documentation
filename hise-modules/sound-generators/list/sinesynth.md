summary:  A simple and lightweight sine wave generator.

It can be used to drive a FM Synthesiser, or stacked together for Additive Synthesis or used as simple enhancement of another sound.

It has two operating modes for the pitch definition :
	
| Musical | Harmonic |
| --- | ----- |
| in octaves / semitones. | As harmonics compared to the root frequency. Use this mode for additive synthesis - it will allow to define the harmonic structure of the resulting sound more clearly. |
	
It also has a internal Wave - Shaper effect, that allows to quickly add some harmonics to dirten up the sound.
