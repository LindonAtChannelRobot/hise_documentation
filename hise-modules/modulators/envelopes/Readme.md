An envelope is a polyphonic, timevarying modulation source. Usually it's considered as an envelope that will apply it's modulation shape on a signal, but it can also modulate other things (eg. MPE modulator or a polyphonic LFO). There are a few inbuilt envelope modulators in HISE, but you can also create your custom envelope modulators with scriptnode.
