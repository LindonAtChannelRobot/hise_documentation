An envelope is a polyphonic, timevarying modulation source. Usually it's considered as envelope that will apply it's envelope shape on a signal, but it can also be other things (eg. MPE modulator or a polyphonic LFO). There are a few inbuilt envelope modulators in HISE, but you can also create your own envelope modulators with scriptnode.
