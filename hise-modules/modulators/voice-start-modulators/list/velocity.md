## Use Table

On the left side of the Table Graph is low velocity, on the right side high velocity. The position of the table-nodes at either end (or any you add in between) determine how incoming velocity values are mapped. So in the default position with the left node at 0 an incoming velocity of 0 will translate to 0 gain.

If you want to reverse the default you can raise the left node to the top and lower the right node to the bottom. Or just enable the **Inverted button**.
