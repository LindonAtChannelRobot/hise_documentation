The installer contains a standalone application and all available plugins for the selected OS (**VST 2.4** for Windows and **VST 2.4 / AU** for OSX).
If you don't want to enjoy the comfortability of a installer, [download the source code](github.com) from Github and compile it yourself.

There is no factory soundpack or preset collection (although it may be added in a later version), just the vanilla application files.



### System Requirements

OS | Version | CPU architecture
-- | ------- | ----------------
OS X | > 10.6 (Snow Leopard) | Intel CPUs (32bit & 64bit Universal Binary)
Windows | Windows 7 | x86 / x64

### Host Compatibility

Host | Version | Plugin Type | OSX | working / known issues
---- |:-----:| :---------: | :-: | ----------------------
Cubase | > 5.5 | VST | Windows | fully working
Ableton | 9.1 | VST / AU | Windows / OSX | fully working
Reaper | 4 | VST | Windows | fully working

These are all confirmed hosts that work with **HISE**. If you have a host that is not listed here, it does not mean it won't work.  
Please drop me an email if you get **HISE** running in your host and I will update the list.

> **AAX** won't happen, because Avid's SDK doesn't allow freeware / open source.

## Latest Version

If you are brave like Mel Gibson, you can put on your blue face colour and download the latest build from GitHub. But do it on your own risk,
this version is not tested and reflects the latest development state!
