The envelopes factory encompasses nodes designed to manage and shape the dynamics of audio signals. These nodes provide functionality for creating and controlling various envelope generators and voice management systems. 

They offer advanced control over the attack, hold, decay, sustain, and release stages of an envelope, with options for customizable curves and modulation. Additionally, they include mechanisms for detecting silence, managing voice states efficiently, and resetting voices based on specific conditions.
