The container factory creates nodes that will hold other nodes as children and therefore provides the basic building blocks for any scriptnode network. The container structure always follows a strict tree paradigm.

There are many containers which modify the processing of their children so if you want a node to be processed with a specific configuration, you need to wrap it into a container.
