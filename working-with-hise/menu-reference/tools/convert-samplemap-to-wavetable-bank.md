This will open the wavetable converter that allows you to create .HWT files that you can load into the [Wavetable Synthesiser](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/wavetablesynth) module.

Click on any of the help buttons to get a description of what the control does. Be aware that if you want to use the Resynthesis modes, you have to get the Loris library [here](https://github.com/christophhart/loris-tools/releases) and copy the dynamic library files into the App data folder of HISE (into a subfolder called `/loris_library`)
