This menu item is only visible in the Snippet Browser window and will copy the embedded script files from the currently loaded snippet back into your current project.

This allows you to quickly integrate the snippets into your project - just load the snippet that you want to import and choose this function.

Any snippet with the tag **Framework** will have one or more embedded script files that contain the functionality (as long with a few example use cases in the snippet itself).

> Note that using this function will override the files in your repository so proceed with caution!
