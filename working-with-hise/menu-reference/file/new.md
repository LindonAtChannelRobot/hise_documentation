Creates a new HISE preset. You can save it in two different ways: 
- As a compressed (.hip) [Archive](/working-with-hise/menu-reference/file#save-archive), which will show up in the HISE projects [Presets Folder](/working-with-hise/project-management/projects-folders/presets).
- As a human readable [XML File](/working-with-hise/menu-reference/file#save-as-xml) which will be saved in the [XmlPresetBackups Folder](/working-with-hise/project-management/projects-folders/xml-preset-backups). (good for version control)
