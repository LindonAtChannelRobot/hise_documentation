This deletes the content of the project's build folder (`{PROJECT_FOLDER}Binaries`). Use this if you encounter glitches at the export which might come from intermediate files not being updated.

> Make sure that you don't put any files that are not autogenerated into this folder - if you add custom C++ files, use the **AdditionalSourceCode** directory.
