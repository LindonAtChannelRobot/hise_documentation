This will grab all .hwt files in the AudioFiles folder and write it into one big chunk that will be saved in the Samples folder. Using this will improve the distributability of the Wavetables, as you can simply copy them like your HLAC files (If you're exporting the samples as .HR1, the monolith file will also be part of that archive).

> Be aware that as soon as you've create a Wavetable monolith file, it will use its content to display the list of available wavetables, so if you keep changing the original wavetables, it will not reflect those changes.
