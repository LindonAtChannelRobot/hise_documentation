You can change the preferences of HISE in the settings dialog, which appears when you click on the Settings icon on the top right of HISE. The settings are organized into multiple categories.

![SettingsWindow](/images/custom/settingswindow.png) 

You can either select one of the category, or go to the All tab, which shows them all. You can also search for settings with the search bar on top.

## Setting files

HISE will create XML files for each setting category at the sensible location for this:

- Project and User settings will be stored in the Project folder (`ProjectInfo.xml` and `UserSettings.xml`)
- the other settings will be stored in the HISE app data folder.

## Categories
