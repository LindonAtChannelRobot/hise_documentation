This is the temporary build directory which HISE will use during export. The compiled executables will be located in a subdirectory called `Compiled`. Now if you don't alter the build process or are interested in the internals of how it all works, you can ignore this folder, the only vital information you will need to take away from this is that you **MUST NOT** edit any file in there - they are autogenerated and removed automatically.

> If you're using Git, this is a perfect candidate for `.gitignore`
