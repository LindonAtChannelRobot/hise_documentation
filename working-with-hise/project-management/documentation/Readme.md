HISE has a powerful embedded documentation system that you can use to create your own documentations for your projects.

The system is covered on these pages:

- General Language Syntax: [Markdown](/working-with-hise/project-management/documentation/markdown)
- Creating links: [Documentation folder](/working-with-hise/project-management/projects-folders/documentation)
- Editing Documentation: [MarkdownEditor](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/markdown-editor)
- Displaying Documentation: [MarkdownPanel](/ui-components/floating-tiles/plugin/markdownpanel)

You can use this to create your [own project documentation](/working-with-hise/project-management/documentation/project-documentation) or [contribute to the HISE Docs](/working-with-hise/project-management/documentation/contributing).
