The Right Panel features five preselected [HISE Floating Tiles](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise) to ease your workflow when working in the Module Panel.


- In the [MacroTable](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/macrotable) you can adjust and refine the Macro values that you can set with the [Macro Controls](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/macrocontrols) in the main topbar. 
- The [ScriptWatchTable](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/scriptwatchtable), [InterfacePropertyEditor](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/interfacepropertyeditor) and [Console](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/console) help you out when you use a [Script Processor](/hise-modules/midi-processors/list/scriptprocessor) directly in the Module Panel. 
- The [Plotter](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/plotter) visualizes the modulation values of [Modulators](/hise-modules/modulators) when you hit the visualization button in each modulators topbar.
