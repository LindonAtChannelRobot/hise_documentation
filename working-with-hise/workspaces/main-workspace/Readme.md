The **Main Workspace** is the area of HISE where you patch together Sound Processors, Modulators and FX ([HISE Modules](/hise-modules)) to create the Audio DSP (DigitalSignalProcessing) architecture of your instrument.

You can find the [Module Panel](/working-with-hise/workspaces/main-workspace/module-panel) in the middle and two additional Panels, [Left Panel](/working-with-hise/workspaces/main-workspace/left-panel) and [Right Panel](/working-with-hise/workspaces/main-workspace/right-panel) to access convenient helper functions.
