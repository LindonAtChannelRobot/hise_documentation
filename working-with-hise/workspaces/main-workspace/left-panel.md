![Left Panel](images/custom/left-panel.png)

The Left Panel is an empty wrapper for adding [HISE Floating Tiles](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise).

**Right-Click** on the surface to add one that matches your current workflow. 

With the button at the top you can add new [Vertical Tiles](/ui-components/floating-tiles/layout/verticaltile) to make space for additional Floating-Tiles.


> E.g: A [Filebrowser](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/filebrowser) and a [SampleMapPool](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise/samplemappool) make sense when you work with a [Sampler](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler).
