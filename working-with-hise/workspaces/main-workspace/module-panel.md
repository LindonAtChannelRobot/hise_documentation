The **Module Panel** is the space where you patch together [HISE DSP Modules](/hise-modules). It always holds the **Master Chain**, which is the parent element of all Modules that you add to it. Click the **plus icon** to add a new [Sound Generator](/hise-modules/sound-generators).

In the signal chain it is also the first and last processed element. Every added [Midi Processor](/hise-modules/midi-processors) preceeds the MIDI Processors of any child and the Gain- and FX Chains are applied to the final sum of all generated sounds at the end.
