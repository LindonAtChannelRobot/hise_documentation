The [Scripting Workspace](/working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace) is a specialised Workspace that features an IDE-like [Code editor](/working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/code-editor) for scripting, side by side with the [Interface Designer](/working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/canvas) which helps you to create a GUI for your plugin.
