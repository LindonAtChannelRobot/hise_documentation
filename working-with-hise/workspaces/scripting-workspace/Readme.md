The [Scripting Workspace](/working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace) is a specialised Workspace that features an IDE-like [Code Editor](/working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/code-editor) for scripting, side by side with the [Interface Designer](/working-with-hise/workspaces/scripting-workspace/canvas) which helps you to create a GUI for your plugin. 

In the top left of the Scripting Workspace you can connect the workspace to any ScriptProcessor that you created in the Module Panel.
