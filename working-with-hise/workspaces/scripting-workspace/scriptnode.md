The editor for scriptnode is trying to use the same principles as the interface designer. You have three main parts:

- a list of all nodes
- the main graph
- a property editor for the selected node

## The Node List


## The DSP Network graph

## The Node Property Editor

## Popup Windows

You can right click on an object in the graph and it will show a modal popup with more detailed tools.

### The Parameter Editor

### The Node Property Popup

### The SNEX Playground
