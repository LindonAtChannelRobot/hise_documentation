### What is HISE?

**HISE** is an open source framework for building sample based virtual instruments. 

### Key Features
- A highly performant **Disk-Streaming Engine** that allows you to stream hundreds of samples in parallel. Powerful `.xml` sample-mapping and HLAC-compression-algorithm included. See: [Sampler](/hise-modules/sound-generators/list/streamingsampler)

- A flexible DSP-Audio **Module system** that lets you combine Sound Generators, Modulators and Effects in a tree-like architecture for maximum efficiency. See: [Hise Modules](/hise-modules)

- A handy **Interface Designer** that makes it easy to hook up an interface with customizable [UI Components](/ui-components/plugin-components) and convenient [Floating Tiles](/ui-components/floating-tiles/plugin).

- Connect & control the interactions with your virtual instrument via the powerful **HISE Scripting Language** (based upon javascript) in an IDE-like environment. See: [Scripting](/scripting) 

- Build upon the **HISE** architecture, include external libraries and get the most out of the Engine with C++. See: [Hraw](/hraw)

- [Export and Compile](/working-with-hise/project-management/export) your **HISE** instruments and plugins as VSTi, AU and Standalone for all major OS platforms and DAWs. 


### Rationale


### Licensing
- **HISE** is published under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) open source licence. (that means, that every compiled (&derived) plugin or VSTi that was built with **HISE** has to be published and open-sourced under the GPLv3 License, too)

- In case that you want to release a closed source product you can aquire a commercial **HISE** license. Please get in touch with us via [email](http://hise.audio).
  
- Furthermore **HISE** is based on the [JUCE](http://www.juce.com) library which additionally has to be licensed for commercial applications: @ https://shop.juce.com/get-juce. 
  
- In the case that you publish an instrument/plugin built with **HISE**  it is welcomed (but not obligatory) to attribute the **HISE** Engine somewhere in your plugin.
